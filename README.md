# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview
Using a credit card dataset from LendingClub, we will be applying different machine learning algorithms to give predictions on classifying a client as being a high-risk or low-risk loan. Because this dataset contains unbalanced classifications, we will evaluate which of these models performs best by looking at their confusion matrices and balanced accuracy scores.
